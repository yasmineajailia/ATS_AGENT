# Skills Data Cleaning Summary

## Overview
Successfully cleaned and validated the 3.2M skills dataset to remove non-skills, fix formatting issues, and create a high-quality skills database for RAG.

## Results

### Before vs After
- **Input**: 3,254,965 rows (messy, unorganized, redundant)
- **After filtering**: 2,730,167 valid skills
- **Output**: 1,991,491 unique clean skills
- **Reduction**: 38.8% of data was noise/duplicates

### What Was Cleaned

#### Removed Non-Skills:
- Job duties and requirements ("experience with", "responsible for", "ability to")
- Generic/vague terms ("experience", "optional", "desirable", "required")
- Experience requirements ("2+ years", "3+ years", "5+ years")
- Physical requirements ("physical demands", "physical ability")
- Benefit terms ("benefits", "pto", "bonus")
- Administrative terms ("asset", "plan", "process", "designation")

#### Fixed Formatting Issues:
- ‚úÖ Spacing: "problemsolving" ‚Üí "problem solving"
- ‚úÖ Apostrophes: "bachelor''s degree" ‚Üí "bachelor's degree"
- ‚úÖ Multi-word skills preserved: "machine learning", "data analysis"
- ‚úÖ Abbreviations expanded: "ML" ‚Üí "machine learning"

#### Filtered Out:
- Year patterns (2020, 2021, etc.)
- Date patterns (Jan, Feb, etc.)
- Emails and URLs
- Too-short entries (< 2 chars, except known abbreviations)
- Too-long entries (> 60 chars)
- Too many numbers (likely codes/IDs)
- Level indicators ("level i", "level ii", etc.)

## Frequency Distribution

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Skills appearing 100+ times | 132 |
| Skills appearing 10-99 times | 5,661 |
| Skills appearing 2-9 times | 446,388 |
| Skills appearing only once | 1,539,310 |

## Output Files

1. **data/skills_cleaned_v2.csv**
   - 1,991,491 unique clean skills
   - Includes frequency count for each skill
   - Sorted by frequency (most common first)
   - Ready for RAG implementation

## Implementation Details

### Cleaner Features:
- **100+ predefined multi-word skills** (machine learning, data analysis, etc.)
- **Multiple separator handling** (`,;/|-‚Äì‚Äî\n\t‚Ä¢¬∑*><()[]{}`)
- **Intelligent validation** (15+ filters to identify non-skills)
- **Normalization** (abbreviations, spacing, apostrophes)
- **Frequency tracking** (calculated before deduplication)

### Script: `clean_skills_data_v2.py`
- Class: `EnhancedSkillsCleaner`
- Pipeline: clean ‚Üí split ‚Üí filter ‚Üí normalize ‚Üí deduplicate
- Configurable: easy to add more filters or normalizations

## Next Steps

### Optional Improvements:
1. **Filter by frequency**: Use only skills appearing 2+ times (removes 1.5M rare skills)
2. **Domain-specific**: Add more multi-word skills for specific industries
3. **Regenerate embeddings**: Create new embeddings cache from cleaned data
4. **Test impact**: Compare RAG performance with original vs cleaned data

### How to Use:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load cleaned skills
df = pd.read_csv('data/skills_cleaned_v2.csv')

# Get top N skills
top_skills = df.head(10000)  # Top 10K most common

# Filter by frequency
common_skills = df[df['frequency'] >= 10]  # Skills appearing 10+ times

# Get just the skill names
skill_list = df['skill'].tolist()
```

## Quality Assessment

### ‚úÖ Successes:
- Removed non-skills (job duties, requirements)
- Fixed formatting (spacing, apostrophes)
- Preserved multi-word skills
- Calculated accurate frequencies
- Reduced dataset by 38.8% while keeping quality

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues:
- Some ambiguous abbreviations still included (pe, ct, emr)
- Some overly specific skills remain (covid19 vaccination)
- Need domain expert review for false positives/negatives

### üìä Data Quality Metrics:
- **Precision**: High (few non-skills in top 100)
- **Recall**: Good (most real skills preserved)
- **Consistency**: Excellent (normalized format)
- **Completeness**: Good (2.7M valid mentions from 3.2M input)

## Comparison: Original vs Cleaned

| Metric | Original (`skills_cleaned.csv`) | Enhanced (`skills_cleaned_v2.csv`) |
|--------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Total unique skills | 2,375,375 | 1,991,491 |
| Format issues | Many (problemsolving, bachelor''s) | Fixed |
| Non-skills included | Yes (experience, 2+ years, etc.) | Removed |
| Apostrophe handling | Broken (double apostrophes) | Fixed |
| Frequency data | Not tracked | Included |
| Quality | Low | High |
